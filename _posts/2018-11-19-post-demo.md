This is how you create a blog post:

STEP 1
Go to the repository and find the folder called _posts.

STEP 2
Create a new file within _posts
      - the file name should be named in the following format YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md
      
STEP 3
Add a Front Matter. This should be included at the top of each post.
       {% highlight language %}

 "comments:true" only if you want a comment box in your post so that other people can leave comments. 
 An additional thing you need to do to add a comment box in your post is to copy and paste the code shown in the image below.
 (You will find the code in other posts)
