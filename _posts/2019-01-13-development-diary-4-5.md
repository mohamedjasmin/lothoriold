One of our meetings that took place shortly after the exam season was purely based on our goals and aspirations for our game. This meeting was a team building exercise and we started off the meeting by allowing each member of our team to choose three of their most influential values. With these values, each member had to say why they chose these specific values over the others and how these values influence them daily. After going around and listening to each member, we decided that the next thing we should discuss are our goals. We started off talking about our long-term goals (so what we would be doing in the next 5-10 years) with our careers, followed up by our short-term goals (within the next year) with our degree results. Finally, we discussed our goals for the end of the game which included what grade we would like to get from this. After discussing our goals, we all understood what each member valued the most and what was least valued.
