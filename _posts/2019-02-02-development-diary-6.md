Once we received feedback after the MVP we decided to conduct a meeting in which we discussed our next stage of action to completing the final version of the game. From the collected feedback it was noticed that there where many areas and features to the game which we planned on developing but for the lack of time and the deadline coming near it was evident that it would not be possible to incorporate all these aspects to a high release quality standard. Thus, we selected 3 main areas of the game that should be our focus, these were quests, inventory and combat systems. Then every team member was given a task to complete within the 3 main areas such as develop the first main quest of wood chopping, or design and implement different weapons the main character can use. This meeting helped us formulate a plan to reach our requirements and ensured everyone understand what their role and tasks.
