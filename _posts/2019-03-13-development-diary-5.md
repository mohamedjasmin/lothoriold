During one of our last group meetings we decided to hold a reflection meeting. We had been working on the game for a while and with the deadline creeping up on us we thought it pertinent to take a short break to reflect on what we have achieved and what still needs doing. Reflection is a key part of the development process as you force yourself to come out of whatever bubble you are in in order to see things from a top-level perspective. 

We began the reflection by pulling out the photos of our Team Project Contract. We dissected it to see whether we uphold the agreement in terms of the atmosphere, commitments, and conflict resolution protocol. On the whole it was a positive reflection, where we felt we had abided by the positive atmosphere and kept to our commitments. Where we felt we fell a bit short was the section in the conflict resolution strategy, whereby group members commit to keeping in close communication with one another, so nobody feels out of their depth at any point.  

Beyond the contract reflection, we also took some time to see if we were doing enough work for the time that had passed. We agreed we could do more and that finishing up key pillars of the game, (i.e. the shop system) needed more attention. As a result, we moved people around in order to allocate more resources to the tasks we deemed most important.
