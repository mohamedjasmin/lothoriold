One of the break-through additions to the game was the inventory system. Not only was it a dynamically loaded inventory system, it also meant the programmers were able to pick up items off the floor. The inventory system was overlaid on the UI; with an icon for the item and a small number for the amount collected. Having an inventory led us to the decision to have NPCs drop items instead of just blood â€“ which takes us to another new addition; the coin pouch. The coin pouch was added in a similar fashion to the inventory, displayed on the UI with a counter. The NPCs drop coins so when the main character goes over the coins, it increments the coin pouch by 5.
