  <tr>
    <td>nTask</td>
    <td>is the task management platform which we used to allocate tasks to each team member, to keep track of the tasks and the deadlines for each task. It helped us become more productive, reduced the time allotted for setting priorities as well as enabling us to differentiate from the four kinds of individual tasks which are: urgent and important, not urgent but important, urgent and important, and not urgent and not important.
